### **Project: Fiverr End-to-End Project**

**Problem Statement:**
Recently, attackers are using freelance job sites such as Fiverr to distribute malware disguised as job offers. Fiverr initiated a Kaggle competition to understand how data science professionals would solve this problem using various methods and techniques.

**Project Objective:**
Leverage data science methodologies to develop an efficient model capable of predicting potential spammers disguising malware as job offers.

**Tools Used:**
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Python, Google Colab, Sklearn (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Extra Tree), and Streamlit.

**Methodology:**
Develop a Potential Spammers prediction model using Sklearn. Experiment with diverse algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Extra Tree to identify the most effective approach. Implement Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly interface for the model.
